Announcing ViTables 1.2.2
=========================

We are proud to present ViTables 1.2.2, the latest release of our viewer for
PyTables/HDF5 files.

As it happens with the entire PyTables family, the main strength of ViTables is
its ability to manage really large datasets in a fast and comfortable manner.
For example, with ViTables you can open a table with one thousand million rows
in a few tenths of second, with very low memory requirements. Also important is
the fact that it is designed to be a multiplatform application, i.e. it runs
flawlessly in Unix (and hence, GNU/Linux), Mac OS X and Windows. The fact that
it runs on top of PyTables ensures its speed and memory efficiency. Finally,
for a better user experience, we have created binary installers for Windows and
Mac OS X. The Unix version is installable using Python distutils.

In this release you will find some bug fixes and usability enhancements,
among them:

- capability for navigating datasets whith even 2^64 rows
- enhanced displaying of datasets
- Spanish translation added

Platforms
---------

At the moment, ViTables has been fully tested only on GNU/Linux, Windows
and MacOS X platforms, but as it is made on top of Python, PyQt and
PyTables, its portability should be really good and it should work just
fine in other Unices.
