ViTables
--------

ViTables is a graphical tool for browsing and editing files in both PyTables
and HDF5 format. With ViTables you can easily navigate through the data
hierarchy, view & modify metadata, view actual data and more.

ViTables has been developed using Python and PyQt4, a binding to Qt4
libraries, so it should run on any platform that support these components
(this includes Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and many other Unices). The interface
and features are the same in all platforms. At the moment, ViTables has been
heavily tested on Linux, MacOS X and Windows platforms.

The User's Guide (in HTML4 and PDF format) can be found in the doc directory.
Please read it. I've written it for you :-)

Feel free to subscribe to the ViTables users group `[1]`_ and to report bugs and
send suggestions or features requests.

For installation instructions on Unix platforms see INSTALL.txt.
